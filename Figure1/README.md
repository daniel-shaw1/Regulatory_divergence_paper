We calculated XY divergence at X-linked ACRs. We used a similar approach as in /Figure2/Analyses/ except without accounting for pungititus genome. We calculated XY divergence in order to compared to XY dn and XY ds.

We compared to previously published XY dn and ds values for coding genes shared on the X and Y chromsoome (Peichel et al. 2020)

We performed a mann-whitney U test between dn, ds, liver ACR and Testis ACR divergence between the X and Y chromosome. Commands are shown in /Rscripts_for_figures/boxplot.r
