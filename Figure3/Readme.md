For Figure 3. X- and Y- specific variants were counted from Figure2, and polymorphisms were counted from vcfs generated from 12 freshwater stickleback males.

Non-coding MK test was performed based on Andolfatto 2005. 

Dn= ACR fixed variant
Ds= Intergenic fixed variant
Pn= ACR polymorphism
Ps= Intergenic polymorphism

NUmbers of variants, and ACR lengths were resampled with replacement using bootstrap.py



##
Histogram.r and low_read_depth were moved to supplement.
