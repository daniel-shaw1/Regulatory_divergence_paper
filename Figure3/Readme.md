For Figure 3. Illumina sequencing from 12 males was processed using GATK pipeline to calculate nucletotide diversity.

We plotted nucleotide diversity across the same set of intergenic sites as used in Figure 2.

We used low_read_depth.pl to remove sites with too low of sequencing coverage on the X and Y.
